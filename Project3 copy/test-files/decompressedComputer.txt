today we tend to think of the computer as an electronic device but, as we
have seen in earlier chapters, there were many automatic computing devices
based on mechanical or electromechanical technology. when the development
of electronic devices reached the stage where reliable components started
to become available, people began to consider their use in computing machines.
the second world war spurred the development of electronics from what was
essentially a small-scale analog industry concentrating on radio circuits
to its status as one of the leading technologies of our day. about that time
it occurred to several different people that this developing technology could
be used as the basis for a calculating machine, but the expense of setting up the
necessary research and development facilities meant that only the truly
inspired, or the very foolish, would attempt any actual construction.
