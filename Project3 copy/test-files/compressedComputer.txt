today we tend to think of & computer as ~ electronic device but, as we
have seen in earlier chapters, &$ we$ m~y automatic comput@ devices
based on mech~ical or electromech~ical technology. when & develop+t
of electronic devices $ached & stage whe$ $liable components started
to become available, people beg~ to consider &ir use in comput@ machines.
& second world war spur$d & develop+t of electronics from what was
essentially a small-scale ~alog industry concentrat@ on radio circuits
to its status as one of & lead@ technologies of our day. about that time
it occur$d to several diffe$nt people that this develop@ technology could
be used as & basis for a calculat@ machine, but & expense of sett@ up &
necessary $search ~d develop+t facilities me~t that only & truly
inspi$d, or & very foolish, would attempt ~y actual construct#.
